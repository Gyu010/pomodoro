## Description
The goal of this project was to practice fundamental frontend concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, timer logic using `setInterval`, and basic UI/UX design.

This project is part of my frontend learning process and focuses on building interactive web applications without using external frameworks.

## How to Use
1. Select a mode (Pomodoro / Short Break / Long Break).
2. Click the start button to begin the timer.
3. Use the stop or reset buttons as needed.
4. Open the settings modal to customize timer durations.
5. An alarm sound will play when the timer finishes.

## Future Improvements
- Add automatic mode switching after each Pomodoro session
- Improve accessibility and keyboard support
- Refactor code structure for better maintainability
